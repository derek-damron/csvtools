*csv-grep*

Overview
--------

    csv-grep is a utility similar to unix grep, but that operates on a specified
column of a delimited file.  It is aware of headers, so the column to match
against can be supplied by name.  Additionally, csv-grep knows not to attempt a
match against the first row in a delimited file when that row is a header.  After
rows are selected by matching the specified pattern in the specified column, 
they are written to the standard output stream.

    The regular expressions used by csv-grep are of the posix variety, much like
like those used by grep.

Examples
--------

    We'll use the following csv to demonstrate csv-grep:

$cat example.csv
num,greeting,int
1,"Hello.",1
0,"Goodbye.",2
0,"Hello, Dave.",3
1,"Hello, \"Matt\", if that is your real name!",4

The -c option supplies a column to match within and the -p option supplies
the pattern to match against:

$csv-grep -f example.csv -c num -p 0
num,greeting,int
0,"Goodbye.",2
0,"Hello, Dave.",3

The -f arugument is optional, if omitted, csv-grep reads from standard input:

$cat example.csv | csv-grep -c num -p 0
num,greeting,int
0,"Goodbye.",2
0,"Hello, Dave.",3

This allows searches to be chained:

$cat example.csv | csv-grep -c greeting -p "Hello" | csv-grep -c num -p 1
num,greeting,int
1,"Hello.",1
1,"Hello, \"Matt\", if that is your real name!",4

Matches can be reversed with the -v flag:

$cat example.csv | csv-grep -v -c greeting -p "Hello"
num,greeting,int
0,"Goodbye.",2

More compilcated matches can be constructed with regular expression syntax:

$csv-grep -f example.csv -c greeting -p "Dave\|Matt"
num,greeting,int
0,"Hello, Dave.",3
1,"Hello, \"Matt\", if that is your real name!",4

Exact matches may be achieved with the ^ and $ symbols, which in this context
operate on the granularity of the data in a field:

$csv-grep -f example.csv -c greeting -p "^Hello\.$"
1,"Hello.",1
