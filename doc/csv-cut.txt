*csv-cut*

Overview
--------

    csv-cut is a utility similar to unix cut, but specialized to work with
delimited files.  It is aware of quoting behaviour, and directions can be given
by referencing column names instead of indexes.  After cutting, the resulting
data is then written to standard output.

Examples
--------

    We'll use the following csv to demonstrate csv-grep:

$cat example.csv
num,greeting,int
1,"Hello.",1
0,"Goodbye.",2
0,"Hello, Dave.",3
1,"Hello, \"Matt\", if that is your real name!",4

The names of columns cut out are supplied as the final positional arguments to
csv-cut (indices may alternatively be supplied if convenient):

$csv-cut -f example.csv num int
num,int
1,1
0,2
0,3
1,4

The -f argument is optional, if ommitted, csv-cut reads from standard input:

cat example.csv | csv-cut num int
num,int
1,1
0,2
0,3
1,4

This allows for chaining of operations:
cat example.csv | csv-cut num int | csv-grep -c num -p 1
num,int
1,1
1,4
